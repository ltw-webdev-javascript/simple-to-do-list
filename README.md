# Simple to-do list

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Make a form with a text input and a submit button.
- When the formâ€™s `submit` event is fired, get the value from the input, and add a new `<li>` onto the page with the text.
- Clicking on the `<li>` tags in the list should toggle them complete/incomplete.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
